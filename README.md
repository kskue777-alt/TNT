# TNT

This repository hosts the TNT mobile application prototype. The `app/` directory contains a Flutter starter project that renders a "Hello TNT" screen so that the project can be bootstrapped quickly.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed. Refer to the [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for detailed steps.
2. Navigate to the Flutter project:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```
3. Fetch the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the project on an available device or simulator:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
